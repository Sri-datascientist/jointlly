        <p className="mb-3">
          Jointlly is a platform facilitator and decision-enablement layer for real estate construction and joint development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We replace blind leads with a first layer of verification and structured validation, helping landowners and builders make clearer, more informed choices before committing.
        </p>

    question: "Is Jointlly a construction company or broker?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3"><strong>No.</strong></p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Jointlly does not execute projects, manage construction, or act as a broker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our role is limited to bringing structure and transparency to how teams are selected. All commercial terms, contracts, and execution responsibilities remain strictly between the involved parties.
        </p>

    question: 'What do you mean by "first layer of verification"?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3">
          A first layer of verification means initial screening and validation, not guarantees.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">We evaluate:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>Past execution history</li>
          <li>Delivery discipline</li>
          <li>Team capability</li>
          <li>Regulatory alignment (FAR, zoning, RERA-readiness)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">
          This helps reduce uncertainty early   but it does not replace independent due diligence.

    question: "Are builders and professionals on Jointlly verified or certified?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3">No certifications or guarantees are claimed.</p>
        <p>
          Builders and professionals are screened based on execution history, team strength, and on-time delivery patterns. Final evaluation and selection decisions always remain with the landowner or partner.
        </p>

    question: "Does Jointlly guarantee project outcomes or timelines?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3"><strong>No.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Jointlly does not guarantee quality, timelines, costs, or outcomes. We enable better starting decisions, not execution control.

      </>
    ),

    id: "6",
    question: "How does Jointlly handle Joint Venture (JV/JD) transparency?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-2">We introduce clarity by:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground mb-3">
          <li>Making regulatory norms visible upfront</li>
          <li>Structuring deal discussions around realistic FAR and feasibility</li>
          <li>Reducing broker-driven bias</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Final JV terms, agreements, and execution are independently negotiated by the parties involved.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "Should I still do my own legal and technical checks?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3">
          <strong>Absolutely   and this is critical.</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Jointlly strongly recommends that all users conduct independent background verification, including:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground mb-3">
          <li>Legal due diligence and title checks</li>

          <li>Contract review with qualified lawyers and professionals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Jointlly does not replace legal, technical, or financial advisors.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "Who is responsible once I engage a builder or professional?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Once you engage a builder, contractor, or designer, all responsibilities lie solely between you and them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jointlly's role ends at facilitating informed selection, not execution or supervision.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    question: "Is Jointlly only for Joint Ventures?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3"><strong>No.</strong> Jointlly supports:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground mb-3">
          <li>Contract construction</li>
          <li>Joint Ventures / Joint Development</li>
          <li>Renovation/Repaint and structural repair</li>
          <li>Interior architecture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The common thread is decision clarity before execution begins.
        </p>
      </>
    ),

  {
    id: "10",
    question: "Why use Jointlly instead of referrals or online portals?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Referrals and portals rely on trust by association.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jointlly introduces structure, screening, and transparency   so decisions are based on information, not hope.
